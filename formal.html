          <p>
            The formal operational stage (Inhelder and Piaget, 1958) begins at about age 11. As adolescents enter this stage, they gain the ability to think in an abstract manner, the ability to combine and classify items in a more sophisticated way, and the capacity for higher-order reasoning.
          </p>
          <p>
            At about age 11+ years, the child begins to manipulate ideas in its head, without any dependence on concrete manipulation; it has entered the formal operational stage. It can do mathematical calculations, think creatively, use abstract reasoning, and imagine the outcome of particular actions.
          </p>
          <p>
            An example of the distinction between concrete and formal operational stages is the answer to the question “If Kelly is taller than Ali and Ali is taller than Jo, who is tallest?”  This is an example of <b>inferential reasoning</b>, which is the ability to think about things which the child has not actually experienced and to draw conclusions from its thinking.  The child who needs to draw a picture or use objects is still in the concrete operational stage, whereas children who can reason the answer in their heads are using formal operational thinking.
          </p>
          <p>
            Piaget (1970) devised several tests of formal operational thought. One of the simplest was the <b>'third eye problem'</b>.  Children were asked where they would put an extra eye, if they were able to have a third one, and why.  Schaffer (1988) reported that when asked this question, 9-year-olds all suggested that the third eye should be on the forehead.  However, 11-year-olds were more inventive, for example suggesting that a third eye placed on the hand would be useful for seeing round corners.
          </p>
          <p>
            Formal operational thinking has also been tested experimentally using the <b>pendulum task</b> (Inhelder and Piaget, 1958). The method involved a length of string and a set of weights. Participants had to consider three factors (variables) the length of the string, the heaviness of the weight and the strength of push.
          </p>
          <p>
            The task was to work out which factor was most important in determining the speed of swing of the pendulum.
          </p>
          <p>
            Participants can vary the length of the pendulum string, and vary the weight. They can measure the pendulum speed by counting the number of swings per minute. To find the correct answer the participant has to grasp the idea of the experimental method -that is to vary one variable at a time (e.g. trying different lengths with the same weight). A participant who tries different lengths with different weights is likely to end up with the wrong answer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Children in the formal operational stage approached the task systematically, testing one variable (such as varying the length of the string) at a time to see its effect. However, younger children typically tried out these variations randomly or changed two things at the same time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Piaget concluded that the systematic approach indicated the children were thinking logically, in the abstract, and could see the relationships between things. These are the characteristics of the formal operational stage.

            <p>
              Several aspects of the conservation tasks have been criticized, for example that they fail to take account of the social context of the child's understanding.
            </p>
            <p>
              Rose and Blank (1974) argued that when a child gives the wrong answer to a question, we repeat the question in order to hint that their first answer was wrong.  This is what Piaget did by asking children the same question twice in the conservation experiments, before and after the transformation.
            </p>
            <p>
              When Rose and Blank replicated this but asked the question only once, after the liquid had been poured, they found many more six-year-olds gave the correct answer.  This shows children can conserve at a younger age than Piaget claimed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another feature of the conservation task which may interfere with children's under-standing is that the adult purposely alters the appearance of something, so the child thinks this alteration is important.  McGarrigle and Donaldson (1974) devised a study of conservation of number in which the alteration was accidental.
            </p>
            <p>
              When two identical rows of sweets were laid out and the child was satisfied there were the same number in each, a 'naughty teddy' appeared.  Whilst playing around, teddy actually messed up one row of sweets.  Once he was safely back in a box the children were asked if there were the same number of sweets.
            </p>
            <p>
              The children were between four- and six-years-old, and more than half gave the correct answer.  This suggests that, once again, Piaget's design prevented the children from showing that they can conserve at a younger age than he claimed.
